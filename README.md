The `flymake-ansible-lint` package provides a Flymake backend for ansible-lint, enabling real-time syntax and style checking for Ansible playbooks and roles within Emacs.

*(This package can also work with Flycheck: simply use the `flymake-flycheck` package, which allows any Emacs Flymake backend to function as a Flycheck checker.)*

## Frequently asked questions

### Why are some ansible-lint error messages truncated?

This issue is a known bug in `ansible-lint`, not in `flymake-ansible-lint`.

It is `ansible-lint` that truncates some error messages:
```
$ ansible-lint -p test.yaml
test.yaml:5: yaml[truthy]: Truthy value should be one of
```
